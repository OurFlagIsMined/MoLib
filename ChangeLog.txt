ChangeLog

3.1.1 June 7th-10th 2019
	- Format() and thus Debug() now Dump()s table arguments
	- GetMyFQN when called to early can fail (for instance at UPDATE_BINDINGS time the realm is nil(!))
	- Darker green for debug to not confuse with guild chat
	- new :Error(formatStr, ...) function
3.1.0 June 6th 2019
	- MoLib can now be installed in a different namespace than the one of the addon's name
	use MoLibInstallInto(namespace, name) to do so
	- As a consequence Debug() and MoLibInit() must be called using : so they can access state
	- Adding multi valued Dump(...)
	- Adding debug Ev handler DebugEvCall
	- prefix seconds (server time) prefix to debug logging
	- adding GetMyFQN fully qualified characterName-normalizedRealm
3.0.0 June 6th 2019
